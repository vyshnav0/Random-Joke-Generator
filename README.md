## About

The Random Joke Generator is a simple web application that fetches random jokes from the JokeAPI and displays them on the screen. It provides two types of jokes: single-line jokes and two-part jokes.

The application is built using HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for fetching data from the API and updating the content on the page.
